<h1>The Captain Of Industry</h1>
<br>
<h4> SCORE = FACTION SCORE + 1VP PER FACTION <a href="miningcolony.html" title="Link to Mining Colonies">MINING COLONY</a>  + 10 VP PER <a href="greatprojects.html" title="Link to Station">GREAT PROJECT</a>COMPLETED</h4>
<p>
<i class="navybluetext">The Captain Of Industry</i> represents a nation's main industrialists and entrepreneurs<br /> 
All industry points and all credits generated from mining colonies and Great projects go to<br /> 
the Captain of industry.  <br /> 
<br>
<b class="navybluetext">Contracts:</b> The Captain of industry is the only player in the faction who can initially<br /> 
build things. Other faction members, who wish to have something built for them, <br /> 
must do so by contracting the Captain of Industry to buy it for them.<br />  
The price charged for this service is up to the players, but once a contract is<br /> 
created it MUST be honored within the faction.<br />
<br>
<br>
These contracts are done by being filled out on the contract build form and then submitted  <br />
to a controller with the total amount of money listed on the contract. The controller <br /r>
then deducts the build cost of the items from the amount given and then hands the rest <br /r>
to the Captain of industry. The controller then hands the items purchased to the faction<br /r> 
member paying for the contract.<br />
<br>
<br>
<h3>NOTE: When the Captain of industry purchases something for themselves,<br /> 
they do not need to fill out a contract.<br /r></h3>

<br>
<h4 class="greentext">SCORE = FACTION SCORE + PIRATE NATION SCORE </h4>
<p>
<i class="redtext">The Underworld Boss</i> represents a nation state's "alternative members".<br /> 
Those who seek power outside of the sanctioned hierarchy of power. They can be <br />
union leaders, smugglers, activists, pirates, outlaws or any other fridge group<br />
players can image. </p>
<p> 
The Underworld Boss starts the game with <span class="navybluetext">10 credits and 1 sabotage card.</span> <br />
<br>
At the beginning of each turn, the The Underworld Bosses for each nation meet together<br /> 
to form the Underworld NATION council. For each structure in the game, the Council generates<br /> 
one sabotage per turn. The council, can then use these points to buy sabotage cards.<br />
How these points are spent is decided by simple majority vote underworld bosses may<br /> 
make any deals to garner votes from other bosses they wish.<br /> 
</p>
<p>
<i>Once purchased</i>, the council then decides which member of the council to give the<br /> 
sabotage cards too. That member can then choose to keep, use, give or sell their sabotage<br /> 
cards too any other player as they see fit. Furthermore, after a sabotage card is placed,<br /> 
the placer can entertain bids for credits to have the card have no effect or even change<br /> 
targets before it goes off. Removing cards in this manner uses up the card. <br />
</p>
Each sabotage card costs 5 sabotage points and can be used to: </p>
<ul><li>Shutdown a structure for 1 turn</li>
	<li>Render a ship ,in orbit, immobile for a turn</li>
	<li>For 2 cards: Cause a single ship to become a pirate ship and be placed under the control<br /> 
	    of the card user (does not need to be underworld boss)</li>
	<li>For 2 cards: Cause a group of space marines to become outlaws under control of the card user<br />
	     (does not need to be underworld boss)</li>
</ul>
<p class="redtext">Pirate and outlaw units are hostile to all non-pirate and outlaws; even if controlled by the same player.<br />
    Pirate and outlaw units may attack other units without any direct mechanical political consequences.<br />
	The identity of the pirate and outlaw unit controller is always hidden</p>
<br>

<h4 class="greentext"> THE PIRATE NATION SCORES 1 VP PER PIRATE SHIP AND PIRATE BASE</h4> 
<br>
<p>
Underworld Boss players can spend any credits they make to build units like any other faction.<br /> 
Like other members, they must contract with the captain of industry to build their<br /> 
items. Any science they buy becomes researched by the chief scientist.<br />
<h4 class="redtext">Any unit built buy the Boss becomes a pirate/outlaws </h4>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<b>People's Revolution:</b> For a cost of 20 credits, the Underworld Boss can have any deployed structure <br /> 
in play, revolt and come under that Boss's control. Doing so, atomically generates 1 space marine<br /> 
for the player. Any hostile space marines on board the structure immediately fight the structure for control.<br /> 
Underworld structures convert all other faction points into credits and generate 2 VPs for the pirate nation<br /> 
<h4 class="redtext">Any units that come under the control of the Underworld Boss become Pirate Nation units.</h4>

<br>
Pirate units are automatically hostile to all other units<br />
except other pirate units. Even units from the same nation as the Boss are hostile<br />
to pirate units. Pirate units may attack and be attacked without causing any negative<br />
mechanical political consequences.<br />

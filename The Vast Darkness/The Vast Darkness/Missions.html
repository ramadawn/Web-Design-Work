<h1>Space Missions:</h1>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Whenever a player wishes to move something from one body in a solar system to another body,<br /> 
they do so by buying a <b>Space Mission</b>. The cost of a space mission is equal to the absolute difference<br /> 
between position value of the starting body and the position value of the destination. The value is <br />
then multiplied by the value of the mission type.<b> In general, once a mission is launched, its existence<br /> 
is public knowledge and it is listed as an active mission on the overhead projector.</b><br />
<br>
(NOTE: Traveling to a moon from its parent body automatically costs 2 Position difference)  
</P>

<p>
<b>Example:</b> Player A wants to move their ship from Earth to Jupiter. Earth has a position value of 1. Jupiter has<br /> 
a position value of 15. Therefore the position cost is 14. Player A wants to get there fast and elects to do a <br />
high G burn (which will get them there in half a turn with +1 initiative) this mission type has a cost factor of 3.<br /> 
Therefore, the total cost of the mission is (14 position value difference times 3) 42.<br />

<h3>Mission Types:</h3>

<strong>Gravity Assist:</strong> <br />
Gravity assist missions are missions that use minimal amounts of fuel and rely heavily on gaining gravity <br />
assists from various planets.<br />
<br>
<b>Gravity assist mission take 3 turns to complete and reduce the cost of the mission to 1/10. <br />
Arrives with an initiative of 0</b> <br />
<br>

<strong>Quarter G Burns:</strong> <br />
These missions use constant fuel all the way but only accelerate using a quarter of a g of thrust.<br />
<br>
<b>Quarter G Burn missions take 2 turns to complete and reduce the mission cost by half.<br /> 
Arrives with an initiative of 1. </b> <br />
<br>

<strong>Half G Burns:</strong> <br />
Same as above but using a half g of continuous thrust.<br />
<br>
<b>Half G burns are your standard mission. They do no change the base mission cost.<br /> 
They arrive at the beginning of next turn with an initiative of 3. </b> <br />
<br>

<strong>Full G Burns:</strong> <br />
These are the first of the half turn burns. They can only be launched during the reaction<br /> 
phase and they arrive during the arrival phase of the same turn. <br />
<br>
<b>Full G Burns double the cost of the mission and they arrive with an initiative of 2.<br /> 
Note it means they go before a quarter G burn mission but after a half G mission.</b> <br />
<br>

<strong>High G Burns: </strong> <br />
These are high G burns all the way and the crew is often required to sleep for most of the mission<br /> 
in order to survive the high gravity.  <br />
<br>
<b>High G burns are launched during the reaction phase and arrive during the arrival Phase.<br /> 
They arrive with an initiative of 4. Which means they always go first.<br /> 
High G burns increase the cost of the mission by 3.</b> <br />
<br>

<h3>Initiative:</h3>
Whenever two units engage in combat or arrive at the same place at the same time, initiative comes into play.<br />
Units gain their initiative either from being in orbit (2) or from thier mission type.<br />
The higher a unit's initiative the better it's position.<br />  
<br>
<b class="navybluetext">Example of initiative:</b><br /> 
<br>
<strong>Example A:</strong> Player one launches a transport on a 2-turn mission for Ganymede carrying a missing colony.<br /> 
The next turn, Player two launches a transport on a one turn mission for Ganymede, also carrying a mining colony. <br />
The two missions arrive at the same time. Since the Player two’s mission has a higher initiative on arrival, <br />
player two will be able to place their colony first. If by the time it arrives, Player One’s mission has no place to land,<br /> 
the mining colony cannot land.<br />  
<br>
<strong>Example B:</strong><br /> 
<br>
Player two launches warships on a 1 turn mission towards one of Player 2s colonies. During the reactions phase,<br /> 
Player one notices the launch and sends ships to intercept. Player one does not have the cash for a high G mission so<br /> 
ops for a full G mission. Due to initiative order, Player two will be able to conduct one full round of attacks <b>BEFORE</b><br /> 
Player one’s ships arrive and join the battle. Arriving at the same time: If to missions arrive at the same time with<br /> 
the same initiative. Players may bid credits to see which one arrives first. If neither player bids, roll a dice. <br />

<h1>The UN Representative</h1>
<br>
<h4>SCORE = FACTION SCORE + UN SCORE </h4>
<p>
<i class="navybluetext">The UN Representative</i> represents the forces of unity trying to bring all humankind together.<br /> 
They are the advocates of free trade, the large multinationals and the dreamers of a united humanity. <br />
They are the large international bodies and the purveyors of cross border associations.<br /> 
</p>
At the beginning of each turn, each UN Representative earns 5 credits per turn + their UN Income.<br />
After income is collected, the UN Representatives meet to form the UN council. To this council,<br /> 
each player donates publicly any portion of their personal funds they wish, and then the council<br />
decides through simple majority how to spend this money. Structures owned by the<br />  
UN convert any points earned into credits. Half of all credits earned by the UN becomes the UN income<br />  
of each UN player(rounded up). These can be spent by each UN member as they wish. <br />
<h4> THE UN SCORES 1 VP PER STRUCTURE THEY CONTROL</h4> 
(NOTE: If there exists a single shipyard owned by any nation. The UN may build Cruisers and Battleships)
<p>
<h3 class="navybluetext">The Armed Forces General</h3>
The Armed Forces General writes all orders for all UN controlled units<br />
The first agenda, of the first meeting, of the UN council is always to vote for the Armed Forces General.<br /h>
The first Armed Forces General is always decided by who has the most votes. In the case of a tie, a revote <br />  
is held. Units owned by UN are under the control of the UN Armed Forces General (who writes all of their <br /> 
orders. While serving as the armed forces general, a UN player may NOT attend UN council meetings<br />
 and may not give credits to the council; though they may give credits to other UN members.<br />
Once elected, the armed forces general remains in control of the position position until 3/4s (round down) of the<br />   
UN Representatives decide to elect a new Armed Forces General. <br /> 
</P>
<p class="redtext"><b>Unlike other forces, a nation can't attack the UN until the UN has attacked them once before.<br /></b>
The UN for it's part, can only declare war on a nation if 3/4s of UN Representatives (round down) agree.</p>  

<p> 
<b class="navybluetext">Individually</b>, UN Representatives can use their personal credits to buy Policy Cards (5 credits), <br /> 
and Technology Cards(10 credits) FOR THE UN. These cards held by the <br /> 
UN Player ONLY benefit UN units. Technology cards held by the UN players, do not automatically go to the<br />  
Chief Scientist (though said player may certainly sell them). When researching a TECH card(10 Credits)<br />
The UN players researches based on the current advancement of their nation.
<p>
The UN Representative may also by units for their nation without the help of the captain of industry.<br />
These units though, are not controlled by the UN player. Instead these units fall under the control of <br />
other players within the nation depending on what is purchased.<br />
Ships and colonies go to the head of state. ground units and mining colonies go to the Captain of industry<br /> 
and research stations go to the head scientist.<br />

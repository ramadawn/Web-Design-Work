<h1>Combat</h1>
<br>
<p> When one group engages another group; combat begins.</p>
<p class="redtext"> Combat between nations or between the UN and a nation, requires a formal declaration<br />
of war.</p>
<p><h3 class="navybluetext">Declarations Of War</h3></p>
<p> Unless a unit is controlled by pirates or outlaws, all units in game are considered peaceful towards<br />
each other until the outbreak of war. In order for a nation's units to attack each other, a declaration of  <br />
war must be declared.<br /></p>
<p> In order to <b class="redtext">declare war</b>, a Head of State, need only inform control that they are declaring war on another nation<br />
Only the <b class="navybluetext">Head Of State</b> can declare war on another nation. The declaration of war has consequences for the<br /> 
<i>Heads of State</i> for both nations.<br /> 
</p>
<p>
<b class="redtext">For each turn that a nation is at war, the Head of State for that nation will loose 2 credits<br />
of income. For the UN, being at war with a nation means that the UN representative for that nation<br /> 
looses their income until peace is restored.</b><br /></p>  
<h3 class="greentext">Making Peace</h3>
<p>
Two parties my end a war at any time provided both parties agree to peace. Any reasonable demands may <br />
be made and accepted to garner peace. Once peace is made between two parties, no declarations of war<br />
may be made between parties for the rest of the game</p> 

<h3 class="redtext">Combat</h3>
<p>
When one fleet engages another fleet. Both player reveal the true size of their fleets.<br />
<br>
Structures have a base initiative of 1 and ships in orbit have a base initiative of 3.<br />
<br>
When combat is initiated, the first thing that occurs is that the initiative of the attacker<br /> 
is compared to the initiative of the defender.<br />
<br>
<ol>
	<li>If the attacker’s initiative is lower than the defenders, combat will only occur if<br /> 
	    the defender allows it.<br />
		<br>
	<li>If the initiatives are equal, regular combat begins.<br />
		<br>
	<li>If the attacker has a higher initiative to the defender, the attacker may either make<br /> 
	    a free attack, start a regular combat or retreat. Making a free attack lowers the attacker’s<br /> 
		initiative by one. If lowering the attacker’s initiative makes the attacker’s initiative equal<br /> 
		to an incoming fleet, the incoming fleet may initiate a regular combat. If after a free attack,<br /> 
		the attacker still has a higher initiative, repeat cycle.<br />
<br>
<h3 class="navybluetext">Essentially an attacker with a higher initiative may use that advantage to make free attacks <br />
 or ensure the defender cannot retreat. If they have 2 or more points of initiative they may do both.<br />
</h3>	
<p class="redtext">
During a free attack, only the attacker fires. 
</p>	
 If there are incoming ships, and regular combat has begun, the incoming fleet enters combat on a round<br /> 
 equal to the attacker’s initiative <b>minus</b> the incoming fleet’s initiative. <br />
<p>
<h3 class="navybluetext">Regular Combat</h3>
<p>
During regular combat, if one side has a lower initiative or is a structure, that side my not retreat from battle.<br />  
The defender fires first by picking a target and then rolling a d10. If the roll is higher than the CV<br /> 
of the target, the target takes a hit point of damage. If the attacking unit has more than one attack, the defender may<br /> 
do this a number of times equal to the number of attacks. The defender does this unit all of their units have fired.<br /> 
Any destroyed attackers are removed from the board and then the attacker fires and does the same as the defender.<br /> 
Repeat this unit one side retreats or one side is defeated.<br />

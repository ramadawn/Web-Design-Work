<i class="navybluetext">The Head Of State</i> represents the State's political elite. The head of state has the advantage<br /> 
of controlling the tax base <b class="navybluetext">(25 credits per turn)</b>. Any credits generated by full colonies automatically goes to the <br />
Head of State. The head of state is the only player who can purchase Interplanetary Government <br />
policies. These policies can never be traded or sold and are purchased with political points.</p>
<br>
<h3 class="redtext">Forces under the control of the Head of State cannot attack forces controlled<br />
by a team mate unless that team mate has attacked the Head of State once already.</h3><br />

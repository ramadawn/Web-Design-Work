<p>
The goal of each player in the Vast Darkness is to Simultaneously maximize their team's score and their personal score.<br />
Teams maximize their score by controlling the largest portion of the solar system by the end of the game and <br />
players maximize their personal score by achieving their own faction objectives. The sum of these two scores<br />
forms a player's total score.

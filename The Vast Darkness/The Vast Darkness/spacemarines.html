<h1>Space Marines:</h1>
<br />
<br />
<p>
Space Marines must always either be with a transport or at a base. Land forces alone<br /> 
at the end of the turn, die automatically. Where as ships are often used to blow things<br /> 
up. Marines are used to capture things. Marines on board a transport can be used to capture<br /> 
things in space or on the ground. If a land force successfully “Hits” in combat, it does not<br /> 
damage the hit point, it instead captures the hit point. Defending Marines that hit, can<br /> 
either kill enemy Marines or take back a captured hit point. Attacking marines can never target<br /> 
defending marines. When the majority of a target’s hit points are captured, the target is captured.<br /> 
All marines, defending the target die.

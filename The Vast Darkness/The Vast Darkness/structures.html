<h1>Space Structures:</h1>
<p>
Space structures form the backbone of power projection in the Vast Darkness.<br />
It is through structures that players claim space, generate additional income,<br />
claim victory points and develop research and government policies.
</p>
<p>
All structures have a base 12 hit points. These hit points can either be captured<br />
(in order to capture the structure) or destroyed (in order to destroy it).<br />
All structures can house an unlimited amount of space marines. Friendly ships in <br /> 
proximity of a structure can repair 1 hit point of damage for the cost of one credit.<br />

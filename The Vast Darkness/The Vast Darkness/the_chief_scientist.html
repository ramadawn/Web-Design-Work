<h1>The Chief Scientist</h1>
<br>
<h4> SCORE = FACTION SCORE + 1VP PER FACTION CONTROLLED <a href="sciencestation.html" title="Link to Station">SCIENCE STATION</a> + 1VP PER TECHNOLOGY CARD IN THEIR HAND</h4>
<p>
<i class="navybluetext">The Chief Scientist</i> represents the state's educated elite.<br /> 
The chief scientist starts the game with a <b class="navybluetext">one-time amount of 20 credits</b>. After that,<br /> 
any additional funds must come from other players, research stations within <br />
their faction, or the sale of any technology they control.<br /> 
<br>
Any new technology cards researched or bought by a nation, are placed in the hands of the<br /> 
chief scientist. Once researched, all players within a faction benefit from the technology cards. <br /> 
That said, <i class="navybluetext">in order for a player to benefit from a technology card, he/she must know that their <br />
chief scientist owns a card.</i> 
<br>
<h3><b>The Chief scientist is NOT obligated to show the other players in their<br />
nation the science cards in their hand; and may even demand things<br /> 
in exchange for doing so.<br /></b></h3>
<br>
(NOTE: Should another faction member acquire a technology card before the chief scientist, <br />
the chief scientist automatically gains that technology card) 
<br>
<br>
(NOTE: Only the chief scientist may sell away their technology cards)<br />
